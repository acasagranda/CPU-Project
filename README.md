# CPU-Project

This is a final project for CS104 at Codecademy.
The project was to build a Python program that simulates some of the functionalities of a CPU.

My program simulates a simplified version of pipelining in a CPU taking instructions in assembly language.
To keep it simple it has no branching and does not do the write-back.

The instructions input the length, width and height of a box then calculates the box's Volume and Surface Area.
